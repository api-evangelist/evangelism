<p>Amazon Web Services — the companys massive cloud computing business — released more than 500 new products last year. 
For every single one, Amazon followed an unconventional development process, AWS SVP Andy Jassy revealed at a recent Macquarie Research summit.Before Amazon developers write a single line of code, they have to write the hypothetical products press release and FAQ announcement. 
Amazon uses this working backwards approach because it forces the team to get the most difficult discussions out of the way early, Jassy says.They need to fully understand what the products value proposition will be and how it will be pitched to customers.</p>
