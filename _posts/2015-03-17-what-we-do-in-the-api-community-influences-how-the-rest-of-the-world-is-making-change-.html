<p>17 Mar 2015   
I was just talking with my friend Oliver Seiler (@0seiler) in New Zealand via email.Oliver is great at keeping me in tune with API related stories out of New Zealand.I was making sure he knew how much I appreciate people like him sending me regular updates, and that it is what makes API Evangelist go around—to which he replied, reminding of how important the work we are doing here in the US API space.Oliver told me what I hear a lot, We still need to sell our story every single day and you wouldnt believe how much anything that comes from particularly you and 18F, but also ProgrammableWeb and GDS in the UK matters to our work.This isnt an isolated case, I hear this a lot from people I talk to in government, enterprises, and other institutions around then globe--the stories we tell are used to make change in how they think and potentially operate.</p>
