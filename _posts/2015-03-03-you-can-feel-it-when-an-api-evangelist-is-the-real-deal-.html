I had the pleasure of finally meeting someone in person, that I feel like I’ve known for years, while I was over in Australia, for API Days Sydney—Keran McKenzie (@keranm), API Evangelist for MYOBapi.I got to drink, and talk with Keran (finally), but more importantly I got to listen to him talk about his approach to evangelism at the accounting API.I have given, and listened to more talks on evangelism and advocacy than I care to remember.I always work hard to make sure I sit and list to as many evangelism talks as I can—there is always something to learn.Kerans talk was informative, thorough, and most importantly it was genuine.</p>
