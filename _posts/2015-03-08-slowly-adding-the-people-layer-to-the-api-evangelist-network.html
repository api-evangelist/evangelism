Im adding a new layer to my monitoring of the API space, what I consider to be the people layer of the API Evangelist network--the actual people who are executing on much of what I talk about, across my research, and storytelling.This is all born out of the network of people I already talk to regularly, to get the stories, and details for the research that I publish regularly.I have been tracking on many of the doers of the space for a while, behind the scenes, and this is just about exposing a select handful of individuals who can help you with some of the areas I discuss in my research and storytelling.Up until now, my research has been about showcasing:
