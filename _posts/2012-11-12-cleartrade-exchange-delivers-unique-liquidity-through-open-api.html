<p>Cleartrade Exchange, the leading OTC trading venue, is now live with an innovative solution enabling orders which are linked to an underlying commodity price to be automatically injected into the market.This unique development was successfully pioneered with lead broker member FIS and allows market-makers to enter, adjust, remove and trade multiple bunker fuel swap orders in real-time, resulting in a firm, two-way spread on two of CLTX’s three bunker contracts for the whole trading day.FIS Bunker Broker, Ali Ersen, said: “The innovative technology developed by Cleartrade Exchange has enabled price discovery and trading of these contracts in a way that was not possible before in this market sector.This market-leading initiative provides a unique service to our clients and is enabling us to continue bringing major developments to this important global market.” “This is another product development driven by feedback from our members,” said Bob Antell, Global Business Development Director for Cleartrade Exchange.</p>
