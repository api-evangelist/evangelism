<p>I have been slowly adding Postman Collections to many of the APIs indexes for my new master stack.I index each API using an APIs.json file, as well as provide a master APIs.json which brings together all of the APIs, into the single portal Ive published to Github.Within some of the APIs, you will see a Postman icon, allowing you to easily import the API definition into postman, directly from each APIs landing page.</p>
