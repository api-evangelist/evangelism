<p>Greetings, Splunk Developer Community!This week we are announcing the new Splunk Developer Guidance program at the Splunk Partner Summit Americas 2015.The main objective is to provide our developer community with tools and guidance to build amazing apps on the Splunk platform and enrich users’ experience in gaining insights from their machine data – where ever it might come from and whatever domain they might be specializing in!We are fully aware that the first thing most devs are looking for is code that they can take apart, learn from, and reuse.That’s why we built reference apps for you.</p>
