<p>23 Feb 2015   
I was just listening to segment on NPR, All Things Considered, about educating students around the environment.Throughout the program I couldn’t help be reminded of a similar imbalance in the world of APIs.Throughout my API experience I’m constantly faced with a separation between what I hear is possible, what I would like to see, and what actually occurs on the ground in startups, small businesses, and within enterprise organizations, and government agencies.You might have to listen to the segment to fully grasp what I mean, but essentially it comes down to this: we’d like a perfect world where we do not negatively impact the environment, and everyone understands the urgency, but in reality there are a lot of real world constraints that prevent us from truly realizing this vision.In the world of APIs, these same constraints exist.</p>
