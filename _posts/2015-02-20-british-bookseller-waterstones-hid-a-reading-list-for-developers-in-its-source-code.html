<p>Here’s an unusual way of recommending books to visitors – British chain Waterstones has just overhauled its website and it’s hidden a reading list for developers in the source code.The recommended books include titles on using a Raspberry Pi to teach yourself Python and primers on HTML and CSS.Visit the site and hit CTRL+U on a PC or CMD+Alt+U on a Mac to check it out yourself.</p>
