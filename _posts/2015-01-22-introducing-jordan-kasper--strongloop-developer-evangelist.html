<p>Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped – turned upside down – and I’d like to take a minute, just sit right there, I’ll tell you how I became the Developer Evangelist of a place called StrongLoop.Well, that didn’t turn out quite as well as I’d hoped, but you get the gist.I’m the newest employee at StrongLoop and will be stepping into the Developer Evangelist role!I’ll elaborate on what I’ll be working on later, but first, I wanted to give you some background as you’ll be hearing from me a lot.How did I get here?</p>
