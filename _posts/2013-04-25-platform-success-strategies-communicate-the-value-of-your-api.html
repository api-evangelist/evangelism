<p>This guest post, part of a series of platform success strategies, comes from Chuck Freedman, Director of Platform Strategy at Mashery.Follow him @chuckstar.Communicating the value of your API is a simple, but often missed, step that can position your platform incredibly well among partners.How you describe the value of your offering is important messaging that should inform visiting partners and developers why your API is worth exploring and how it brings the missing content or service to their business and/or application.What were once no-frills landing pages to API access and documentation, API portal homepages now must greet partners and developers alike, carrying the same exciting proposition that your business development and evangelism teams do.</p>
