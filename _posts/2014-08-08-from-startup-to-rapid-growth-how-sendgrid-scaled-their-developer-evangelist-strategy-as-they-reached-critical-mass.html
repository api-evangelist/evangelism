<p>Over the last five years, SendGrid has grown from a Techstars startup to a company of over 230 employees and steadily increasing revenue.During that time, their community team has transformed from one MBA grad running the show to a team of 14 specialized developer evangelists and community managers (6% of the overall SendGrid team and counting).SendGrid’s product is aimed at developers building applications that need to send mission-critical emails.It’s incredibly important – and lucrative – stuff.The company now provides email infrastructure and delivery solutions for companies like Pinterest, Snapchat, AirBnb, and Uber, and has sent out as many emails as McDonald’s has sold hamburgers.</p>
