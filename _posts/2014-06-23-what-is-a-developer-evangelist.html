<p>Greetings from Seattle, my name is Rex St.John and I am a Developer Evangelist at Mashery, an Intel company.Many people are curious about what Developer Evangelists do so I am writing this article to outline what its all about: Making customers successful with their target audience of developers.   
The Mashery API Network  
As the leader in the API Management space, Mashery seeks to help businesses open up their APIs to external developers in a controlled and secure way. Whenever a company wants to expose their internal data (say, Beats Music) to external developers, there are a number of questions that must be answered.</p>
