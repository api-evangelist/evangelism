<p>MasterCard announced a new series of 10 hackathons spanning the globe today.The series will focus on developers and be called MasterCard Masters of Code.You might be forgiven for thinking this was a new announcement for an old event. MasterCard has sponsored a number of FinTech events already in 2014, including at least one last month. Honestly, we can’t keep track of them — we know one was held as recently as November, in conjunction with Money2020.</p>
