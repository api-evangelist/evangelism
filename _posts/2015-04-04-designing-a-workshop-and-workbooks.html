<p>Over the last couple of months I’ve been presenting workshops on API technical writing in various locations.The workshops last a full day, and consist of lectures alternating with hands-on sessions.During the hands-on sessions, which last an hour, the participants work through learning material and exercises in a workbook.I put quite a bit of thought into the design of the workshop and workbooks.A few people have commented that the resulting structure works well, so I’ve decided to blog about it in the hope other technical writers will find it useful.</p>
