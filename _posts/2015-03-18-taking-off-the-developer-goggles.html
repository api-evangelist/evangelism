<p>One of the very best things about working at Basecamp is “Everyone on support (EOS)”.That’s our policy where everyone on the team—no matter what their normal job is—spends one day per month as a customer support agent.Each time my turn comes around I marvel at the truly excellent service our team provides every single day in what is a very tough job.Our team’s ratings and response time are insanely good even with dead weight like me pulling down their averages one day a month.I have no idea how they all remain so positive in a role where it feels like all day you’re saying “no”.</p>
