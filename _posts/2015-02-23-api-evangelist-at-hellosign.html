<p>Organizing and volunteering at local, national, and international developer events.Encouraging developers to build products using HelloSign, and showing them the advantages of doing so.Gathering feedback and reporting back to the team, helping guide engineering, sales, and marketing decision making.HelloSign has a growing legion of active users and a vocal group of advocates, some of which stop by our office to get their photo taken with our team (Seriously, this has happened more than once).We believe our API is the future of how documents will be signed and weâ€™re looking for the ideal candidate that excels at connecting to others within the developer community.</p>
