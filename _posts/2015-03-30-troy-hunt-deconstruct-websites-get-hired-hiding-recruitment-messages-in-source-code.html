<p>The other day I did a security workshop at a firm here in Sydney and one of the things we did was a proxy a bunch of traffic and inspect what was going on behind the scenes.Among the expected hilarity that always ensues from these sorts of exercises (you can find heaps more of this in my Hack Your API First course), one of the guys at the event found this in the response headers of Airbnb:
Awesome – an HTTP response header designed for humans!Of course it’s only special humans that actually go to the trouble of reading response headers behind mobile APIs (although it looks like any requests to airbnb.com return it), special humans the likes of which may actually have the chops to work at a place like Airbnb building software.It seems that Kevin is a genuine bloke at Airbnb too and not just a HR contact, but an Engineering Manager.</p>
