<p>At business software-as-a-service vendor Citrix Podio, a renewed focus on promoting partners and API integrators is stabilizing API adoption overall and helping create a commercially successful ecosystem.“Since creating a team to focus on the platform part of our offering, we’ve seen a clear increase in both number of actively used third-party implementations and amount of interest in extensions built by others than us,” says Martin Müntzing, head of product at Citrix Podio.“The number of active API keys has risen by 30%, and visits to the Extensions page almost doubled.“With the launch of our new public website, integrations and extensions now have a more prominent place in the list of benefits you get from building your business on Podio, he says.From the Features page, you can now easily get to information on ready-made extensions and learn more about how to build your own.</p>
