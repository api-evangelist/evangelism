<p>Venturesity takes a “hackathon approach” to finding developer talent for startups.Venturesity was created upon the notion that resumes cannot fully portray a candidate’s potential — or their shortcomings.Instead, a hackathon gives a real-world problem that candidates can solve to prove their talent and usefulness to a potential employer.The auction feature of Venturesity’s approach allows multiple employers to bid on candidates based on the candidates’ performance over the course of a hackathon.“A lot of companies are fighting for good talent.</p>
