<p>17 Apr 2015   
I get a number of folks contacting me about their API ideas, and email or call me, looking to schedule a meeting or briefing to discuss the API ideas.This is something I always reply with a request for existing links to the portal, blog, Twitter, and Github accounts of those involved.Even when companies are doing something interesting, I prefer to approach it like any random Joe or Jane would, from the public portal, with very little information up-front.Your overall approach to API, the value it delivers, and ease of integration should speak for itself, in my opinion.I am sure there are plenty of companies still who would prefer a briefing, meeting, call, or other personal touch, sales or pitch like engagement, but increasingly in an API driven world, a self-service, pull approach is preferred.</p>
